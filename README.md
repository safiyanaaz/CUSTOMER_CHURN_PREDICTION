# CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION

So this dataset's got a few columns,it's got row number, custom ID, surname.So what we're looking at is a dataset of a bank.
Of course it's all fictional, it's not a real bank,but it's very realistic.there's going to be 10 thousand customers.
So 10 thousand rows in this dataset.

Why did they undergo this whole thing,what's the challenge here?

Well, the bank has been seeing unusual churn rates.So churn is when people leave the company and they've seen customers leaving at unusually high rate and they want to understand what the problem is and they want to assess and address that problem.
And that's why they've hired you to look into this dataset for them and give them some insights.

And how did this dataset come to be?

Well, six months ago the bank said alright

there's a big problem.

We've gotta take a sample of our customers.By the way this is a sample of it.10 thousand is a tiny number for this bank.
This bank has millions of customers,it operates, this fictional bank operates in Europe and three countries France, Spain, and Germany.And they have lots and lots of customers.So what they did is they took this sample of 10 thousand customers and they measured six months ago everything they knew about them.


Their custom ID, their surname, credit score,their geography, their agenda, their age, their tenure, so how long they've been with the bank, the balance of the customers at that point in time, the number of products they had at that point in time.
So the number of products is things like how many products do they have, do they have a savings account, do they have a credit card, do they have a loan, did the customer have a credit card or not, so there's a yes/no flag, is the customer an active member, another yes/no flag. Active member can be measured differently by different organizations, it could be whether or not
the customer logged onto their online banking in the past month, whether they did a transaction in the past two months or some other measure like that. And estimated salary, so the bank doesn't know the salary of the customers, but based on the other things they know they could estimate a salary for that customer and they also give you this information. So six months ago they measured all of these things and said alright so for these 10 thousand randomly selected customers we're going to just watch them. And six months down the track we're going to check who of those customers lef who of those customers stayed.And that's what this column Exited represents here. It tells you whether or not the person leftthe bank within those six months.
